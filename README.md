# Cyberfiction
Welcome to Cyberfiction! This project is a clone of the award-winning Cyberfiction official website. It showcases my skills in HTML, Canvas, Tailwind, Vanilla JS, GSAP, and ScrollTrigger.

Cyberfiction is a web application that aims to replicate an immersive and interactive experience. By leveraging HTML, Canvas, and Vanilla JS, I have created a visually captivating environment that offers a unique and engaging user experience. The animations in this project are done using GSAP and ScrollTrigger, which adds dynamic and smooth transitions to the website.

## Features
- Authentic cyberpunk design: The project incorporates futuristic visuals and elements that closely resemble the original Cyberfiction website.
- Interactive canvas: The Canvas API is utilized to create dynamic and engaging animations, allowing users to interact with the replicated environment.
- GSAP and ScrollTrigger animations: The project utilizes GSAP and ScrollTrigger to create smooth and captivating animations throughout the website.
- Tailwind CSS: The project utilizes Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, to ensure a responsive and visually appealing layout across different devices.
